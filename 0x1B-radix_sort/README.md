## General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
No standard library functions allowed. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Please use this data structure for this project:

```C
/**
 * struct listint_s - singly linked list
 * @n: integer
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 * for Holberton project
 */
typedef struct listint_s
{
    int n;
    struct listint_s *next;
} listint_t;
```

## Tasks

Technical interview preparation:

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm

Prototype: void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the LSD radix sort algorithm
You can assume that array will contain only numbers >= 0
You are allowed to use malloc and free for this task
You’re expected to print the array each time you increase your significant digit (See example below)

```bash

$ cat 0-main.c
```

```C
alexa@ubuntu-xenial:0x1B-radix_sort$ cat 0-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "sort.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7};
    size_t n = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    print_array(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    radix_sort(array, n);
    printf("\n");
    print_array(array, n);
    return (0);
}
```

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-radix_sort.c print_array.c -o radix

$ ./radix
19, 48, 99, 71, 13, 52, 96, 73, 86, 7

71, 52, 13, 73, 96, 86, 7, 48, 19, 99
7, 13, 19, 48, 52, 71, 73, 86, 96, 99

7, 13, 19, 48, 52, 71, 73, 86, 96, 99

$
```
