## Tasks

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an
N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

## Usage

Run the program using

```
./0-nqueens.py N
```

 - If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
   print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

 - N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
   - If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line,
   and exit with the status 1
   - If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new
   line, and exit with the status 1

 - The program should print every possible solution to the problem
   - One solution per line
   - Format: see example
   - You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order

You are only allowed to import the sys module


## General requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called menger.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

## Installation
In your terminal, git clone the directory with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/rodrigocruz13/holbertonschool-interview_prep
cd 0x0C-nqueens
```

## Compile

No compilation process needed


## Usage

Run the program using

```
./0-nqueens.py N
```
where N is an integer bigger than 3
