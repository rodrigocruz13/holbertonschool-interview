## Tasks

Technical interview preparation:

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6

minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations
